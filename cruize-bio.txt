H3110,
We are cruixers 
- a community of creatives[artistically & technically].
<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->
<p>We are a group of normal humans from earth brought together by the mutual love for tech, 
all we want is to create, break and write code.

<p>we could all be in our private space sipping coffee writing beautiful code, some of 
which might not make it to the outside world, but instead we choose to come together and 
build even more beautiful and awesome code, we believe that great innovation is collaborative.
cruize_labs is a space that is welcoming to all who want to share, create, collaborate 
and learn with peers.</p>
